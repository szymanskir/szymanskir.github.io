      <description>Introduction Impostor Syndrome is a state in which a person&amp;rsquo;s confidence in themselves is way lower than their competencies. Many of us (including myself) have and still are struggling with it. I tried to work on it using approaches from resources on how to beat or overcome impostor syndrome. However, none of those seemed to particularly work in my case.
The real game changer for me was learning that impostor syndrome actually has its benefits, that can help you long term and that at the same time you can minimize its negative implications.</description>
