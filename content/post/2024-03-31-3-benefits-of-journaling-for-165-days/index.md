Journaling is a topic I have been interested in for the last couple of years. Specifically, the potential mental health related benefits you get from it.

Historically I was never able to make the habit stick... Until now! Today my streak is 165 days of journaling every day.

In this post I will describe the benefits I have noticed during that time along with some tips that helped to stick with the habit.

## Benefit 1: I process my emotions on a daily basis

I journal daily and that means I write about my day every day. Whenever something upsets me  during the day, I will be writing about it.

It prompts me to think deeply about why am I feeling a particular way. *For example why did I get upset in this particular situation?*

It allowed me to better understand myself and communicate better how I feel to my friends and my partner.

## Benefit 2: I feel more optimistic and happier

One of my journaling prompts is *what are you grateful for?* 

It forces me to think every day about the positive things that happened or try to put a positive twist on the negative things that happened throughout my day.

This built a habit of staying optimistic and prevents me from focusing on the bad things.

For example: an event happens during the day that made me mad and my partner talked with me and supported me throughout this situation.

Thanks to the mentioned prompt I focus on the fact that I have a supportive partner instead of overfocusing on the unpleasant event.

Like Dale Carnegie said in [How to Stop Worrying and Start Living](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4866.How_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Start_Living?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=GDgCAnxqFJ&rank=1): *Think and act happy and you will be happy* and it seems to be working.

## Benefit 3: I know what a *great day* is for me

I tag each of my journal entries with one of the tags:
1. *mood-great*
2. *mood-good*
3. *mood-neutral*
4. *mood-bad*

After 165 days of journaling I am able to check what days got the *mood-great* tag and understand what happened during them that made them great.

In my case it’s usually a combination of:
1. Getting something done e.g. work related, hobby related or getting a chore done that has been waiting for a long time
2. Quality time with my partner/friends/family
3. A new experience e.g. trying out a new food or checking out a new place in our city

Now, I know that if I make time for those things, the chances of having a great day increase!

## What finally made me stick to journaling
I found an app that made it fun to journal and motivates me to journal.

The app I am using is [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/), it contains features that I really like.

### Feature 1: Memories from past years
I love that photo feature where I start my day and I get presented with *memories from past years*
(photos taken on the same day but in previous years).

Day One promises to do the same thing but with journal entries. I cant's wait to see in 3 years past notes on how my day was!

### Feature 2: Sustainable streaks feature 
Streaks are addicting (looking at you Duolingo!). Having a large streak motivates me to keep journaling.

At the same time, the app does not punish you with a lost streak when you come back from a party after midnight and forget to journal. You can edit a journal entry to a particular date and keep your streak going.

### Feature 3: Map showing places where you journaled
You can view a map that shows you places where you journaled. It’s a super fun view that reminds me of my travels!

It’s also fun to go back to a journal entry, see how my day was and check where I journaled.

## Conclusions
After journaling for 165 days I noticed those 3 benefits:
1. I process my emotions on a daily basis
2. I feel more optimistic and happier
3. I know what a *great day* is for me

And I hope to continue to journal for years to come.

If you tried journaling but didn’t manage to make it stick, I recommend using the Day One app.
