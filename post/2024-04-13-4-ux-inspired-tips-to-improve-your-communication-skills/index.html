  <section class="post-content"><p>Communication is an interface for interacting with another person. Just like a UI you use to interact with some digital product.</p>
<p>Similarly to how you have delightful and frustrating apps, you can encounter cases where communication with one person is super fun and easy while in other cases it might be a source of frustration.</p>
<p>In this post I‚Äôd like to explore the topic of communication from the perspective of design concepts I learned in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things">The Design of Everyday Things</a> and how we can leverage UX concepts to make our communication better.</p>
<h2 id="tip-1-provide-visible-system-status-in-your-communication-channel">Tip 1: Provide Visible <em>System Status</em> in your Communication Channel</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs frustrating when you don‚Äôt get any information back when communicating with a person.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs frustrating because:</p>
<ol>
<li>You might not know when it‚Äôs ok to ping again</li>
<li>You don‚Äôt know when you can realistically expect an answer</li>
</ol>
<p>Imagine you wrote to a person on Slack that you barely know. You know neither of those two things.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to setup statuses on Slack e.g. that you are taking a break or having lunch and that you expect to be back at a given time.</p>
<p>This gives the person additional information on what is happening - like a good error message in the app.</p>
<p>For example, compare</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄûAn error occurred‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄûAn unexpected error occurred. Please try to refresh the site. If the error persists pleases tech out on ‚Äûsupport@email.com‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes the person feel in control of the situation and reduces frustration.</p>
<p>A good heuristic to think about here is: <em>does the recipient of my message know what will happen next and when will it happen</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, not all messages require a reply, in those cases it can be a good idea to add a reaction/emoji that shows you read the message (the <em>message delivered</em> indicator is not enough).</p>
<h2 id="tip-2-make-it-easy-to-start-the-conversation">Tip 2: Make it Easy to Start the Conversation</h2>
<p>A part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_action_cycle">Human Action Cycle</a> is the execution stage where the user plans a series of actions to achieve a specific goal.</p>
<p>Imagine you are new in a project and you have a question - where should you reach out for help?</p>
<p>We should make it easy to know how and where to communicate.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assign a buddy who is the main point of contact for a new person - that way by default the person can reach out to their buddy</li>
<li>Create slack channels with meaningful names and helpful descriptions - this allows a person to quickly find a channel and use it properly (See <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/217626408-Create-guidelines-for-channel-names">Create guidelines for channel names</a>)</li>
<li>If your team maintains an internal service, provide a page for asking for help</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tip-3-use-forcing-functions-in-your-messages">Tip 3: Use Forcing Functions in your Messages</h2>
<p>Sometimes you might need to communicate with a group of people to get some information from them.</p>
<p>Just sending a question to a group might not be an effective way to do it. For example if you ask a broad and open question, it requires more effort from the recipient to answer them. There is also a risk that you will get answers that do not focus on the thing you are interested in.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why it can be useful to apply lockouts to your communication and provide a list of answers to choose from.</p>
<p>This works very well in case of yes/no questions. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi team, I wanted to propose that we move the review meeting this week from 1:00 CET to 3:00 CET.</p>
<p>Our stakeholders are attending a conference and won‚Äôt be able to make it. Please react:</p>
<p>üëçWorks for me, let‚Äôs move it to 3:00pm CET</p>
<p>üëéI don‚Äôt like the idea, let‚Äôs keep the meeting at 1:00pm CET</p>
<p>üéàI am fine with both 1:00pm CET and 3:00 CET</p>
<p>üïêNone of the options work for me (please propose a new slot in the üßµ)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, not only you made it easier to reply (it&rsquo;s just the matter of picking the right emoji). But you also narrowed down the responses to the ones you are interested in.</p>
<h2 id="tip-4-use-natural-mappings-in-your-responses">Tip 4: Use Natural Mappings in your Responses</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/natural-mappings/">Natural Mappings</a> embed the relationship between the user input and the result of their action.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a more complex discussion about multiple interrelated topics. You provide a response on a similar level of complexity and turns out your colleague is not sure to which parts of your response corresponds to which parts of his original message.</p>
<p>In those cases in can be useful to provide a mapping in form of quoting the parts of the original message you are responding to. For example, let&rsquo;s assume we receive the following message during code review:</p>
<p><em>I really like the progress bar you added. It looks really neat!</em></p>
<p><em>I am not sure I fully understand the way you update the progress in the progress bar - what are the % values based on?</em></p>
<p><em>BTW there seems to be a test failing in the CI pipeline that is not related to the changes you made here. Have you had a chance to look into it?</em></p>
<p>There are 3 different topics within that message, to make our response easy to understand we can quote each part we are replying to, to make the response easier to understand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I really the progress bar you added it looks really neat!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Thanks, happy to hear that you like it!</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I am not sure I fully understand the way you update the progress in the progress bar - what are the % values based on?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I included docs/design/approach_to_calculating_progress.md describing the selected approach along with other considered approaches</em>. Let me know if that clarifies things!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>BTW there seems to be a test failing in the CI pipeline that is not related to the changes you made here. Have you had a chance to look into it?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I created Issue #123 about this. I added the results of my investigation there. Let&rsquo;s continue the conversation there.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Communication can have a good and bad UX, that means we can leverage UX concepts to make our communication better such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Providing visible system status</li>
<li>Making it easy to start conversations</li>
<li>Using forcing functions in messages</li>
<li>Using natural mappings in responses</li>
</ol>
