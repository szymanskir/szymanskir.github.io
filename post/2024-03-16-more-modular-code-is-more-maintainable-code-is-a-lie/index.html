  <title>&#39;More modular code is more maintainable code&#39; is a lie - Ryszard Szymański</title>

  
  
  <meta name="description" content="I often hear the following phrase &ldquo;thanks to doing ___ the code is now more modular and more maintainable&rdquo;. Sounds reasonable, but it doesn&rsquo;t capture the full picture.
There are cases, when more modularity might make things less maintainable.
First let&rsquo;s establish what I mean by maintainable. Maintainable code is code that is easy to change.

  <section class="post-content"><p>I often hear the following phrase <em>&ldquo;thanks to doing ___ the code is now more modular and more maintainable&rdquo;</em>. Sounds reasonable, but it doesn&rsquo;t capture the full picture.</p>
<p>There are cases, when more modularity might make things less maintainable.</p>
<p>First let&rsquo;s establish what I mean by <em>maintainable</em>. Maintainable code is code that is easy to change.</p>
<h2 id="example-1-extracting-things-into-a-separate-package">Example 1: Extracting things into a separate package</h2>
<p>With that in mind, think about the following situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are building an app</li>
<li>You implemented a functionality that might be reusable, so you extract it out into a separate package</li>
<li>You put that package in a separate repository</li>
<li>You get a new app requirement that requires you to change some of the logic that you extracted out of the package and additional changes on the app side as well</li>
<li>Now, to implement that requirement you need to make 2 changes in 2 separate repositories</li>
<li>You apply the change to the package and release a new version</li>
<li>Now you can make a change to the app and bump the version of that package</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s imagine we didn&rsquo;t extract a package out of that app. What would happen instead of steps from 5 to 7?</p>
<p>Well, you would be able to submit a single PR that contains the same changes made in the previous scenario.</p>
<p>We had good intentions, we wanted to make things more modular by keeping things tidy in their own separate packages.</p>
<p>But as a consequence we made it harder to make changes to the app as now our feature implementation requires more steps.</p>
<p>Imagine how difficult things would get, if we had 5 packages in different repos? In the worst case scenario we would need to make 6 changes (5 package repos + 1 app repo) to implement one functionality.</p>
<p>On top of that, we will need to keep track of which package versions are compatible with which app version. This adds on additional complexity.</p>
<p>A keen eye might notice that we could have used a monorepo structure instead. That means keep all packages and the app in a single repository. That would allow us to apply changes in multiple places in a single pull request.</p>
<p>Some technologies provide tooling that makes it easy to keep an app and related packages in a single <em>container</em>. For example when using Visual Studio you have <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2022">solutions that can contain multiple packages</a>.</p>
<h2 id="example-2-keeping-styles-separate-from-your-components">Example 2: Keeping styles separate from your components</h2>
<p>Another situation, where I faced issues with modularity, is keeping styles separate from components. For example having a dedicated folder for all your stylesheets like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>components/
├─ buttons/
│  ├─ button1.js
├─ form_controls/
│  ├─ form_control1.js

stylesheets/
├─ colors.css
├─ styles1.css
</code></pre><p>This might seem neat at first, but based on the file structure are you able to guess where the styles of <code>button1</code> are kept?</p>
<p>Depending on the technology, you might be able to find that information based on the imports and your IDE features might even allow you to get to that file with a single click.</p>
<p>Even if you have that option, the constant jump and forth between the component file and the stylesheets when implementing new changes can cause a large overhead.</p>
<p>Also during code review, you look at a changed css file and need to figure out which components are being affected.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I personally prefer using utility-first CSS (like in <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first">tailwind</a>), where I would have no separate files for my styles and just apply a set of class names to my component.</p>
<p>Now, I have both my component code and it&rsquo;s styles in one file making it easier to make edits and review in pull requests.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Making things more modular does not always make things more maintainable. It can actually make things less maintainable if not used properly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why when modularizing things, let&rsquo;s check if we are not accidentally making things harder to change in the future.</p>
<p>A good heuristic to consider before <em>extracting things out into a separate module</em> is <em><strong><a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/cohesion-vs-coupling">&ldquo;the code that changes together, stays together”</a>.</strong></em></p>
