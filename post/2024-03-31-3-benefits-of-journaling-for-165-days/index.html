    <h1>3 benefits of journaling for 165 days</h1>
  </header>
  <section class="post-content"><p>Journaling is a topic I have been interested in for the last couple of years. Specifically, the potential mental health related benefits you get from it.</p>
<p>Historically I was never able to make the habit stick&hellip; Until now! Today my streak is 165 days of journaling every day.</p>
<p>In this post I will describe the benefits I have noticed during that time along with some tips that helped to stick with the habit.</p>
<h2 id="benefit-1-i-process-my-emotions-on-a-daily-basis">Benefit 1: I process my emotions on a daily basis</h2>
<p>I journal daily and that means I write about my day every day. Whenever something upsets me  during the day, I will be writing about it.</p>
<p>It prompts me to think deeply about why am I feeling a particular way. <em>For example why did I get upset in this particular situation?</em></p>
<p>It allowed me to better understand myself and communicate better how I feel to my friends and my partner.</p>
<h2 id="benefit-2-i-feel-more-optimistic-and-happier">Benefit 2: I feel more optimistic and happier</h2>
<p>One of my journaling prompts is <em>what are you grateful for?</em></p>
<p>It forces me to think every day about the positive things that happened or try to put a positive twist on the negative things that happened throughout my day.</p>
<p>This built a habit of staying optimistic and prevents me from focusing on the bad things.</p>
<p>For example: an event happens during the day that made me mad and my partner talked with me and supported me throughout this situation.</p>
<p>Thanks to the mentioned prompt I focus on the fact that I have a supportive partner instead of overfocusing on the unpleasant event.</p>
<p>Like Dale Carnegie said in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4866.How_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Start_Living?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=GDgCAnxqFJ&amp;rank=1">How to Stop Worrying and Start Living</a>: <em>Think and act happy and you will be happy</em> and it seems to be working.</p>
<h2 id="benefit-3-i-know-what-a-great-day-is-for-me">Benefit 3: I know what a <em>great day</em> is for me</h2>
<p>I tag each of my journal entries with one of the tags:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>mood-great</em></li>
<li><em>mood-good</em></li>
<li><em>mood-neutral</em></li>
<li><em>mood-bad</em></li>
</ol>
<p>After 165 days of journaling I am able to check what days got the <em>mood-great</em> tag and understand what happened during them that made them great.</p>
<p>In my case it’s usually a combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting something done e.g. work related, hobby related or getting a chore done that has been waiting for a long time</li>
<li>Quality time with my partner/friends/family</li>
<li>A new experience e.g. trying out a new food or checking out a new place in our city</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I know that if I make time for those things, the chances of having a great day increase!</p>
<h2 id="what-finally-made-me-stick-to-journaling">What finally made me stick to journaling</h2>
<p>I found an app that made it fun to journal and motivates me to journal.</p>
<p>The app I am using is <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a>, it contains features that I really like.</p>
<h3 id="feature-1-memories-from-past-years">Feature 1: Memories from past years</h3>
<p>I love that photo feature where I start my day and I get presented with <em>memories from past years</em>
(photos taken on the same day but in previous years).</p>
<p>Day One promises to do the same thing but with journal entries. I cant&rsquo;s wait to see in 3 years past notes on how my day was!</p>
<h3 id="feature-2-sustainable-streaks-feature">Feature 2: Sustainable streaks feature</h3>
<p>Streaks are addicting (looking at you Duolingo!). Having a large streak motivates me to keep journaling.</p>
<p>At the same time, the app does not punish you with a lost streak when you come back from a party after midnight and forget to journal. You can edit a journal entry to a particular date and keep your streak going.</p>
<h3 id="feature-3-map-showing-places-where-you-journaled">Feature 3: Map showing places where you journaled</h3>
<p>You can view a map that shows you places where you journaled. It’s a super fun view that reminds me of my travels!</p>
<p>It’s also fun to go back to a journal entry, see how my day was and check where I journaled.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>After journaling for 165 days I noticed those 3 benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>I process my emotions on a daily basis</li>
<li>I feel more optimistic and happier</li>
<li>I know what a <em>great day</em> is for me</li>
</ol>
<p>And I hope to continue to journal for years to come.</p>
<p>If you tried journaling but didn’t manage to make it stick, I recommend using the Day One app.</p>
